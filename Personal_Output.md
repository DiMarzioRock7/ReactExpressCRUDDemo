This file is supposed to contain what I've learned from the NTU evaluation tasks assinged to me, Alan and an under estimated job seeker.

The tasks are:
  1. Three buttons using SVG buttons.
  2. A table with 3 columns:
      - Name.
      - Edit.
      - Delete.
  3. A form submit button.
  
Required technology stack:
  1. ReactJS – As the main User Interface technology
  2. NodeJS – As the local I/O interface
  3. MySQL/MariaDB – As the application SGDB

My undetstanding of React after finishing the tasks is, React is a front-end framework for drawing pages' purpose。
What makes it different from drawing HTML directly is we could break entire long pages with html page (trunk) and components (branches).
